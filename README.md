<!-- LIST OF IMPROVEMENT -->

## List of Improvement can be done

If I got more I time would focus some of the improvements mentioned below

- Add more types in overall project
- PlayerContainer file gets little congested so I would definitely love to refactor some of the codes.
- Above file also has some repeated code would definitely like to reuse those in a more polished way and make it more reusable and scalable.
- Would love to use custom hooks in above file that would definitely reduce some of the repeated code.
- Would love to polish the style a bit further.
- When we click on 'Play New Game' it reloads the page. Would love to avoid such thing and want to add some different alternate logics.
